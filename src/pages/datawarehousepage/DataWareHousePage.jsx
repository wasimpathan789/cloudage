                Data warehousing is the process of constructing and using a data
                warehouse. A data warehouse is constructed by integrating data
                from multiple heterogeneous sources that support analytical
                reporting, structured and/or ad hoc queries, and decision
                making.
                <br />
                A data warehouse is a type of data management system that is
                designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI)
                activities, especially analytics. Data warehouses are solely
                intended to perform queries and analysis and often contain large
                amounts of historical data. <br /> A Data Warehouse works as a
                central repository where information arrives from one or more
                data sources. Data flows into a data warehouse from the
                transactional system and other relational databases

                The virtual data architecture of a warehouse is physically
                managed atop one or more data platforms, including traditional
                relational database management systems (RDBMSs), newer DBMSs
                (for columns, NoSQL, and graph), file systems (of which Hadoop
                is becoming increasingly common), and object stores (typically
                cloud-based). <br />
                It also includes a highly diverse ecosystem of tools, such as
                those for reporting, analytics, integration, quality, metadata,
                development, and administration. <br />
                Finally, for speed, scale, interoperability, and high
                availability all the above infrastructure components rely
                heavily on underlying enterprise hardwareâ€”namely CPUs, server
                memory, networks, storage, and clouds.
